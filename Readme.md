# FE3 Reverse Recruitment Maker

Program that generates a reverse recruitment ROM for Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo.

This should be compatible with any ROM, including JP and TL-patched ROMs, but I have not tested it extensivley.

## Compiling

Simply run "make" to generate an executeable in the build folder. All required ini files will be copied as well.
